# CS441_Snek
It's snake. Yyyyyyep.
Three screens: title, game, gameover
# Screens
## Title
Simple title screen with some text prompting the player to tap the screen. Tapping the screen starts the game. In the background is the starting snake, moving around completely randomly.
## Game
It's the snake game. Get the food, grow longer, don't hit the walls, don't hit yourself. Player gets a score of however many food items they pick up. Hitting the walls or your own snake brings the player to game over.
## Game Over
A screen that displays the score, and two buttons: one to start over (back to the title screen), and one to exit the app.

As you can tell, the game is quite simple. It would probably make more sense to count this as my project 5, and my original submission for 5 as this project.
